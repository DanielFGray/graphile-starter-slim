/*
 * The sessions table is used to track who is logged in, if there are any
 * restrictions on that session, when it was last active (so we know if it's
 * still valid), etc.
 *
 * In Starter we only have an extremely limited implementation of this, but you
 * could add things like "last_auth_at" to it so that you could track when they
 * last officially authenticated; that way if you have particularly dangerous
 * actions you could require them to log back in to allow them to perform those
 * actions. (GitHub does this when you attempt to change the settings on a
 * repository, for example.)
 *
 * The primary key is a cryptographically secure random uuid; the value of this
 * primary key should be secret, and only shared with the user themself. We
 * currently wrap this session in a webserver-level session (either using
 * redis, or using `connect-pg-simple` which uses the
 * `connect_pg_simple_sessions` table which we defined previously) so that we
 * don't even send the raw session id to the end user, but you might want to
 * consider exposing it for things such as mobile apps or command line
 * utilities that may not want to implement cookies to maintain a cookie
 * session.
