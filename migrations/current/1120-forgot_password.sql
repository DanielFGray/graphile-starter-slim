/*
 * When a user forgets their password we want to let them set a new one; but we
 * need to be very careful with this. We don't want to reveal whether or not an
 * account exists by the email address, so we email the entered email address
 * whether or not it's registered. If it's not registered, we track these
 * attempts in `unregistered_email_password_resets` to ensure that we don't
 * allow spamming the address; otherwise we store it to `user_email_secrets`.
 *
 * `app_public.forgot_password` is responsible for checking these things and
 * queueing a reset password token to be emailed to the user. For what happens
 * after the user receives this email, see instead `app_private.reset_password`.
 *
 * NOTE: unlike app_private.login and app_private.reset_password, rolling back
 * the results of this function will not cause any security issues so we do not
 * need to call it indirectly as we do for those other functions. (Rolling back
 * will undo the tracking of when we sent the email but it will also prevent
 * the email being sent, so it's harmless.)
